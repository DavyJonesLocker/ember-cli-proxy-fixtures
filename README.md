## About ##

Capture Ember CLI proxy server responses for faster playback on the
second run.

This is only intended for use with the test suite. The idea is in some
cases you may be running your integration tests against a live server
that is also running in its test environment. Making those requests,
even though it is local, can add up for a large integration suite.
Especially if you are blocking requests on database rollbacks and
fixture inserts. If you are controlling these via API endpoints on the
test server then you should see significant speed improvement from this
module.

## Install ##

```bash
npm install ember-cli-proxy-fixtures --save-dev
ember generate ember-cli-proxy-fixtures
```

## Usage ##

All requests that `jQuery.ajax` will be captured through `jquery-mockjax`. This
includes requests that go through ember-cli's proxy.

All proxy fixtures are saved to `tests/fixtures/proxy`. They will be namespaced
under a directory matching the module name for the test and each file name will
match the test itself. Contained within is the captured requests and the
recorded responses for playback.

The first time you run the test suite it will record all information then write
to the fixture files after the test suite is complete.  Multiple requests to the
same endpoint for a test will be recorded multiple times and played back via an
offset. This module treats each
response as unique.

If you have made changes to the server and expect a different response
simply run:

```
rm -rf tests/fixtures/proxy
```

No need to restart the server. Restart the test suite and all responses
will once again be recorded.
